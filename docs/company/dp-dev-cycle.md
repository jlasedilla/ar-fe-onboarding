- Breakdown big anxieties into smaller anxieties
- Inputs might come from the following:
    - Mock-up Design
    - Functional Specs
    - RTM (Requrements Traceablitiy Matrix)
    - Task Ticket
## Design | Document | Implement | Test

- During this period, the goal is to smash each small anxiety until the big anxiety are completed
- Activities on these stages might include the following:
    - Create components or reuse if existing
    - Design and document components
    - Test source code and make sure lines are covered
        - Commit updates regularly
## Review
- Activities includes:
    - Create a pull request (PR) for review
